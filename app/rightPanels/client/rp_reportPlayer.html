                Report people for spamming, being overly abusive towards others or soliciting.

                <br><br>

                Do not report people because they attacked you or destroyed your villages.

                <textarea class="form-control" rows="6" id="reasonText" placeholder="Why are you reporting this player?"></textarea>
                <br>

                <button class="btn btn-block btn-primary" id="reportPlayerButton">Report Player</button>
                <button class="btn btn-block btn-primary" id="cancelButton">Cancel</button>

                <br><br>

                When someone is reported they can't post in forums or chatrooms for a while.  The more people who report them the longer they are unable to post.  Who reported them is not visible but the report and reason can be seen by everyone in the global alerts.
